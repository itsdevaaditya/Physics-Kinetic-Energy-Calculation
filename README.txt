Download and Run the .exe Program if you want to use the program.

How to use:
1. Choose which what variable do you want to find out to calculate the variable.
2. Input every constant that the program required to Successfully Calculate the Variable.
3. Press "Hitung" to Calculate every Number that you input.

Note: (Optional) thing is an Alternative way if you didn't have one of the input variable, by Input '0' on the first Input order that required by the program.

This is a My Hobbies Project based on my Schools Physics Material. And ofcourse if there any problem or else with the code, I couldn't fix the program because I'm still learning how to program using a Python, and the .exe thing have an Additional help by ChatGPT, so yeah..

This project I made just for fun.

Physics - Mechanical Energy

ME = PE + KE

PE =  m*g*h
KE = 1/2*mv²

basically,
ME = m*g*h + 1/2*mv²

Properties
ME stands for Mechanical Energy
PE stands for Potential Energy
KE stands for Kinetic Energy
m = Mass (kg)
g = Gravitation (m/s)
h = Height (m)
v = Velocity Speed (m/s)

Physics Kinetic - Formula: Basically only based program that run on terminal, and it reveal how the formula / programs works!

Physics Calculations Programs: The Actual Program that running as GUI (Graphical-User Interface) and run the "Physics Kinetic - Formula" Program but in a user-friendly ways... (please take note that the program is written with an Additional Help by ChatGPT)
