This is a My Hobbies Project based on my Schools Physics Material. And ofcourse if there any problem or else with the code, I couldn't fix the program because I'm still learning how to program using a Python, and the .exe thing have an Additional help by ChatGPT, so yeah..

This project I made just for fun.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Physics - Mechanical Energy

ME = PE + KE

PE =  m*g*h
KE = 1/2*mv²

basically,
ME = m*g*h + 1/2*mv²

Properties
ME stands for Mechanical Energy
PE stands for Potential Energy
KE stands for Kinetic Energy
m = Mass (kg)
g = Gravitation (m/s)
h = Height (m)
v = Velocity Speed (m/s)

Physics Kinetic - Formula: Basically only based program that run on terminal, and it reveal how the formula / programs works!

Physics Calculations Programs: The Actual Program that running as GUI (Graphical-User Interface) and run the "Physics Kinetic - Formula" Program but in a user-friendly ways... (please take note that the program is written with an Additional Help by ChatGPT)
